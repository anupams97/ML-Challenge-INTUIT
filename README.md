## Problem Statement
1)	Count	the	number	of	passengers	on	the	ship	based	on	Gender.	
2)	Count	the	number	of	passengers	on	the	ship	based	on	Class.	
3)	Count	the	number	of	passengers	on	the	ship	who	are	children	(Age	less	than	16	years).	
4)	Find	the	number	of	children	in	the	various	classes.	
Bonus:	Can	you	plot	the	above	results	?	
5)	Replace	all	NULL	and	NAN	values	in	the	dataset	programatically.	
Note:	You	may	replace	the	missing	values	in	numeric	feature	by	mean/median	and	in	
categorical	features	by	a	suitable	dummy	value.	
6)	Find	the	number	of	passengers	who	were	alone	and	who	were	with	family.	
7)	What	percentage	of	passengers	survived	in	each	Class?	
8)	Find	the	percentage	of	passengers	who	survived,	based	on	Gender.	
9)	Did	having	a	family	member	increased	the	chances	of	survival?		
Hint	:	Find	the	percentage	of	passengers	who	survived	and	were	with	Family	members.	
10)	Fit	a	classification	model	which	can	predict	whether	a	person	survived	or	not.	Try	to	
maximize	the	accuracy.
